# Program that computes pythagoras triples

1. Program uses euclied formula.
2. In O(nÂ²) time complexety.
3. Program made to impress my math teacher.

1. 25k limit  = 312,487,500   triples and took 4.122  seconds to calculate
2. 50k limit  = 1,249,975,000 triples and took 16.668 seconds to calculate
3. 100k limit = 4,999,950,000 triples and took 69,186 seconds to calculate (nice)
